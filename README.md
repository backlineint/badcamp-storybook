# Generic Drupal Web Components

Inspired by [@generic-components/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@generic-components/components) this project aims to create a library of generic web components that are accessible, framework agnostic, possible to style, and easy to use with data provided by [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org).

This project is also making the bet that while it is common to use frameworks like React, Vue and Angular today, over time having a solid library of compatible web components will be a valuable asset for Drupal projects.

Guiding Principles:
* It should be easy to use these web components in decoupled Drupal projects with JSON:API data provided by Drupal Core.
* It should also be possible to use these same components within Drupal's traditional Twig based templating engine.
* While additional components may be contributed, this project will primarily focus on creating components following along with [related strategic Drupal initiatives](https://www.drupal.org/project/decoupled_menus_initiative).
